  "description": "Use this repo to review solutions to algorithms that I've solved on sites like [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com) and [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com).<br /><br /> Each folder will have solutions written in various languages I know or have messed around with. There are some algorithms that may be solved in multiple languages but most will be solved in only one.<br /><br /> Every file, regardless of language, will solve one algorithm problem. Each file will also have a brief description of the problem trying to be solved as well as have a link to the original problem. I do my best to comment in my code to explain what peices of the algorithm are doing and why I chose to solve it a certain way.<br /><br /> If you'd like to suggest a problem for me to try, or if you'd like to talk through some of my solutions please reach out to me through my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kade-esterline/). Please consider taking a glance at my [portfolio](https://kadecodes.dev) as well as my blog posts on [dev.to](https://dev.to/kadeesterline).",
