Hi my names Kade Esterline, thanks for checking out my projects this walkthrough will be for my project called Harmony

Harmony is a easy to use communication and collaboration tool that was built with Ruby on Rails and React, the app is styled with tailwind and is using Postgres for the database

After getting signed in or signing up for a new account users can join or create their own rooms

Rooms that a user is a member of will show on the far left and channels available in a room are available in the list next to the rooms

From a room users can send messages and reply to others using a rich text editor via tiptapjs, gifs using the giphy api and files using ActiveStorage and AWS S3

In the upper right corner you'll see some information about the room like who the moderator is as well as the invite code to add people to your room

Moderators have elevated privledges that allow them to delete messages from other users, but only the user that sent the message or reply can edit them

That's going to wrap up this quick walkthrough of Harmony, if you have any questions or comments I'd love to hear from you either directly through my email on my resume, through the contact page of my portfolio or on LinkedIn, thanks for watching and have a good rest of your day
